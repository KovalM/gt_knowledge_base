<p>The undirected route inspection problem can be solved in polynomial time by an algorithm based on the concept of a T-join. Let T be a subset of the <i></sc_element sys_idtf = "rrel_vertex">vertex</sc_element></i> set of a graph. An <i></sc_element sys_idtf = "rrel_edge">edge</sc_element></i> set J is called a T-join if the collection of vertices that have an odd number of incident edges in J is exactly the set T. A T-join exists whenever every connected component of the graph contains an even number of vertices in T. The T-join problem is to find a T-join with the minimum possible number of edges or the minimum possible total <i></sc_element sys_idtf = "nrel_weight">weight</sc_element></i>.

For the route inspection problem, T should be chosen as the set of all odd-degree vertices. By the assumptions of the problem, the whole graph is connected (otherwise no tour exists), and by the handshaking lemma it has an even number of odd vertices, so a T-join always exists. Doubling the edges of a T-join causes the given graph to become an Eulerian multigraph (a connected graph in which every vertex has even degree), from which it follows that it has an <i></sc_element sys_idtf = "nrel_eulerian_cycle"> eulerian cycle</sc_element></i>, a tour that visits each edge of the multigraph exactly once. This tour will be an optimal solution to the route inspection problem.</p>
