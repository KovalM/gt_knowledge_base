We using <i></sc_element sys_idtf="algorithm_dinitsa">Dinitsa's algorithm</i></sc_element>.At each iteration, using the breadth-first search, we determine the distances from the source to all the vertices in  <i><sc_element sys_idtf="concept_residual_network">the residual network</sc_element></i>. We construct a graph containing only such edges of <i><sc_element sys_idtf="concept_residual_network"> the residual network</sc_element></i> at which this distance grows by 1. We exclude from the graph all dead-end vertices with edges incident to them until all the vertices become non-dead-end. (A peak is called a dead end, except for the source and sink, into which no edges enter or from which no edges extend.) On the resulting graph, we look for the shortest increasing path (it will be any path from s to t). We exclude the edge with the minimum bandwidth from <i><sc_element sys_idtf="concept_residual_network">residual network</sc_element></i>, again exclude the dead-end peaks, and so far there is an increasing path.
