The main idea is to find the most suitable tasks for the most suitable employees using ideas of  <i><sc_element sys_idtf  = "algorithm_hungarian">hungarian algorithm</sc_element></i> . We initially believe that all employees are suitable and give them tasks. Then, until all the tasks are distributed, we assign the most suitable task (along the optimal edge) to the employee, if the problem was not found we reduce employee requirements.In this way, the Hungarian tree is built, outside it the remaining graph will include the remaining tasks and workers, as well as developers with non-optimal tasks. Next, these mismatches are calculated for the "mismatch" of workers and tasks, and then based on this, unused developers are added to tree and the most redistributed workers are redistributed in an optimal way.
