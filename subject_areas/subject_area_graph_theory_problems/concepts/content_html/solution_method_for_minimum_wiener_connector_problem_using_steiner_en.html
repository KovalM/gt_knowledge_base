There is a constant-factor approximation algorithm for the minimum Wiener connector problem that runs in time O(q(m\log n+n\log ^{2}n)) on a graph with n vertices, m edges, and q query vertices, roughly the same time it takes to compute shortest-path distances from the query vertices to every other vertex in the graph.The central approach of this algorithm is to reduce the problem to <i><sc_element sys_idtf="problem_steiner">the Steiner tree</sc_element></i>, which admits a constant-factor approximation in particular instances related to the minimum Wiener connector problem.
