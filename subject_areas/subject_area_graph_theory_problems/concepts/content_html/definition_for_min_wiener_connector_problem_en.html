The minimum Wiener connector problem is the problem of finding the minimum <i><sc_element sys_idtf="concept_wiener_connector">Wiener connector</sc_element></i>. It can be thought of as a version of the classic <i><sc_element sys_idtf="problem_steiner">Steiner problem</sc_element></i>, where instead of minimizing the size of the tree, the objective is to minimize the distances in the subgraph.
